# Welcome to Neurodevs üß†ü§ñüëãüèª

Welcome to the Neurodevs GitHub organization, where I, as a solo developer, create portable, open-source tools for neuroinformatics. This work represents a commitment to developing robust, flexible, and privacy-conscious software that empowers researchers, clinicians, and individuals to analyze and understand complex neuroinformatics data. Much of the current work revolves around implementing real-time biosignal processing.

## About

Neurodevs builds on the ubiquity of Node.js and TypeScript to develop cross-platform, portable solutions tailored to the unique demands of neuroinformatics. This technology stack provides the near-universal deployability of JavaScript, while still allowing integration with established tools in languages like Python, MATLAB, R, and Julia. The goal is to deliver solutions that adapt to various platforms, from servers to computers, tablets, phones, watches, and beyond.

## Guiding Principles

* Craftsmanship: Good code shows care through TDD by the 3 Laws, refactoring, design patterns, clean code, and more
* Portability: Each package runs on virtually any device via Node.js, from desktops to mobile and cloud
* Privacy First: Emphasis on local data processing ensures user privacy while maintaining compatibility with cloud workflows
* Interoperability: Solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing neuroinformatics tools and workflows

## Background

Many Neurodevs projects originated from work conducted under SBIR, STTR, and TACFI grants. Most of these packages have been deployed on U.S. Air Force bases worldwide in initiatives supporting mindfulness training, sound experiences, and other wellness programs. I have never been directly affiliated with the USAF, instead working with a startup called [Lumena](https://lumenalabs.com/) for the past 5+ years. My aim remains advancing open-source software for neuroinformatics.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to the Neurodevs ecosystem and consider pull requests on a case-by-case basis. Contributions should adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) by the 3 Laws and align with the general conventions established across Neurodevs repositories. If you‚Äôre unsure about the fit of your contribution or want to gauge my receptivity, feel free to message me beforehand. I promise I'll respond. 

I, Eric, am always open to collaboration! Whether you‚Äôre interested in contributing code, sharing ideas, or exploring potential partnerships, you can reach out to me on Bluesky at @ericthecurious or email me directly at hello@ericthecurious.com.
