# Welcome to Neurodevs üß†ü§ñüëãüèª

Welcome to Neurodevs, where I develop portable, open-source tools for neuroinformatics as a solo developer. My mission is to support researchers, clinicians, and individuals in integrating data across diverse modalities and scales to better understand the human nervous system at an individualized level. Current efforts focus on implementing real-time biosignal processing.

## About

Neurodevs builds on the ubiquity of Node.js and TypeScript to develop cross-platform, portable solutions tailored to the unique demands of neuroinformatics. This technology stack provides the near-universal deployability of JavaScript, while still allowing integration with established tools in languages like Python, MATLAB, R, and Julia. The goal is to deliver solutions that adapt to various platforms, from servers to computers, tablets, phones, watches, and beyond.

## Guiding Principles

* **Craftsmanship**: Good code shows care. TDD by the 3 laws, refactoring, design patterns, clean code, and more
* **Portability**: Each package runs on virtually any device via Node.js, from desktops to mobile and cloud
* **Privacy First**: Emphasis on local data processing ensures user privacy while maintaining compatibility with cloud workflows
* **Interoperability**: Solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing neuroinformatics tools and workflows

## Personomic

Personomic is my vision for an individualized, N-of-1 neuroinformatics platform that integrates diverse data and knowledge sources. Data sources are specific to the individual, encompassing biosignals such as EEG, PPG, ECG, and EDA, along with genomics, neuroimaging, and more. Conversely, knowledge sources are broadly designed to apply to most individuals, specific subpopulations, or universally to all humans. They include neuroanatomical ontologies, structural regions, network connectivity patterns associated with certain conditions, and much more.

I intend to apply Personomic to conduct N-of-1 research on my own chronic illness to an unprecedented level of detail, including a particularly unusual and experimentally manipulatable case of right-sided C-tactile allodynia. To the best of my knowledge, no other unilateral case has been described in existing literature. Astonishingly, I can temporarily and reproducibly abolish this condition through vestibular, gustatory, auditory, and visceral interventions. These distinct sensory modalities only converge in the left insular cortex, and thus I presume it's central to my condition.

## Background

Many Neurodevs projects originated from work conducted under SBIR, STTR, and TACFI grants. Most of these packages have been deployed on U.S. Air Force bases worldwide in initiatives supporting mindfulness training, sound experiences, and other wellness programs. I have never directly been part of the USAF, instead working with a startup called [Lumena](https://lumenalabs.com/) for the past 5+ years. My aim remains advancing open-source software for neuroinformatics.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to the Neurodevs ecosystem and consider pull requests on a case-by-case basis. Contributions should adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD) by the 3 Laws and align with the general conventions established across Neurodevs repositories. If you‚Äôre unsure about the fit of your contribution or want to gauge my receptivity, feel free to message me beforehand. I promise I'll respond. I'll also answer opened issues and am otherwise happy to help.

I am always open to collaboration! Whether you‚Äôre interested in contributing code, sharing ideas, or exploring potential partnerships, you can reach out to me on Bluesky at @ericthecurious or email me directly at hello@ericthecurious.com. I will warn you that I charge a healthy rate for any contract work :)
